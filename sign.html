    <p>sign is a programming language that i have created, and it comes in two flavours:</p>

    <p><em>### "what is it for?"</em></p>
    <p>sign is a language meant to toy around in. it is in no way a good replacement of anything else, and shouldn't be treated as such. instead it offers another look at how programming could work.</p>
    <p><em>### "why did you make it?"</em></p>
    <p>i made sign and signpad as an experiment. before i began work on it i wasn't a very skilled coder, heck i didn't even know what an array was. this project was meant as a way to speed up my coding knowledge, and as a fun challenge. the same turned out true for thego, and we both learned a lot along the way. maybe someday we'll finish it, who knows.</p>
    <p><em>### "what can it do?"</em></p>
    <p>signpad can't do much, really. but it's fun nontheless. it has a restrictive text-based graphics system, with its own fun tileset creatively called signscii. you can make fun little graphics in it, jokes to prank your friends, cellular automata, and maybe a simple game. but that's about it.</p>
    <p><em>### "is it foss?"</em></p>
    <p>yup! on the download page you can find the full source code, all at the low low price of nothing! just download it and have fun!</p>
